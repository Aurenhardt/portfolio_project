# Personal Portfolio Project

This is the project repository for my personal website. It's intent is to demonstrate my skills in creating a website UI/UX, ideally it will incorporate all I know with regards to 
web development. 

Development Link: http://ec2-54-151-90-78.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/

Goal: Create a functioning website to act as a proof of skill and a personal portfolio.

*** When this website is done, it will be recreated in Square Space so is to minimize security issues, the link will still live and maintained however.***
